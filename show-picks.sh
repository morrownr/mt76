# show-picks.sh - list openwrt/mt76 commits not yet cherry-picked into this tree.
#
# Run it from your morrownr/mt76 clone. It needs a git remote named "openwrt"
# pointing at the openwrt mt76 repo. If you do not have one yet:
#
#     git remote add openwrt https://github.com/openwrt/mt76.git
#
# It reads the "(cherry picked from commit ...)" lines that git cherry-pick -x
# adds, so keep using -x and this stays accurate.
#
# To drop a commit you have decided not to take, put its id in skip-picks.txt
# beside this script, one per line, reason after a #:
#
#     a1b2c3d4e5f6  # mt7981 firmware, not a chip we ship
#
# Short or long id, either works. Skipped commits stop showing up in the list.
