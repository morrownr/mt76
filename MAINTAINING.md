# Maintaining morrownr/mt76

How patches get into this tree, written plain so anyone lending a hand can do it without breaking things. If something here doesn't match what you're actually seeing in the repo, trust the repo, not the doc.

## What lands here, and where it comes from

Three kinds of change end up in the tree:

1. Our own work. The install and uninstall scripts, the dkms.conf, the README, firmware updates, and the occasional driver fix we write ourselves.
2. Commits pulled from openwrt/mt76. That's OpenWrt's mt76 tree, the one Felix Fietkau maintains, and it's where most mt76 bug fixes and new-chip support turn up first. We take the fixes we want one at a time instead of merging the whole thing, because our tree builds standalone and carries its own compat guards, and a wholesale merge would fight both.
3. Kernel compat. Small guards in the driver code that keep the tree building on older kernels. These live in the source, not as separate patch files. More on that below.

## Getting a change in

Two ways, depending on who's doing it and whether it's ready.

Straight to main is how @morrownr works day to day. Edit, commit, push. If it turns out wrong, revert it and try again. No branches. It's the right call for small, obvious fixes where a review would just slow things down.

    git add <files>
    git commit -m "short description of the change"
    git push

For anything bigger, or anything you'd want a second set of eyes on before it's live, don't push it to main yourself. Either send the diff to @morrownr and let him put it on main, or open a pull request so it can be looked at in place. Sending the diff is the better move when the work isn't ready for the public yet.

That last point matters because the repo is public. The second you push a branch or open a PR, anyone can see it. So if a change should stay private until it's done, keep it off the repo and send the diff instead.

If you do want a PR, it's the branch you push to that keeps it from merging:

    git checkout -b some-fix
    git add <files>
    git commit -m "short description of the change"
    git push -u origin some-fix

The branch name is just a label. Nothing merges on its own. GitHub shows a "Compare & pull request" button, and the PR stays open until someone merges it.

## Getting an unfinished fix to a tester

Now and then you've got a fix that isn't ready to merge but you want one person to try it, a reporter on the exact adapter that's failing, say. Push it as a branch and point them at it so they can clone that branch and install, or build it and send them the module directly. It stays off main until their result says it's good.

## Pulling a commit from openwrt/mt76

Most of the real driver work comes from here. Point git at openwrt once, find the commit you want, copy it onto our tree, build-test it, push.

One-time setup:

    git remote add openwrt https://github.com/openwrt/mt76.git
    git fetch openwrt

fetch just pulls their commits into your copy. It doesn't change any of your files and it doesn't touch main.

Find what's worth taking:

    # what openwrt has that we don't
    git log --oneline main..openwrt/master

    # only the commits touching a driver you care about
    git log --oneline openwrt/master -- mt7921/

Their branch is master, ours is main. We never check out their branch, we just borrow one commit off it.

Copy the commit over:

    git cherry-pick -x -s <commit-id>

cherry-pick makes a fresh copy of that one commit on top of where you are. It gets a new ID because it's sitting on a different parent. The two flags earn their keep:

- -x records a "cherry picked from commit ..." line, so anyone can trace it back to openwrt.
- -s adds your Signed-off-by line. Set your name and email once with git config --global user.name and git config --global user.email, and the sign-off uses those.

Short commit id or long, git takes any unique piece of it. Use the 12-character version when you write it down somewhere, it's long enough not to get mistaken for anything else.

When a cherry-pick doesn't apply cleanly, it's almost always one of two shapes. Either openwrt changed a function we've wrapped in a compat guard, in which case keep their change and put the guard back around the new version. Or openwrt touched code we'd already patched a different way, which is rarer, and you look at both and decide what to keep.

## Deliberate differences from upstream

Two spots in the tree are intentionally not what openwrt/mt76 (or Felix's tree) does. Both were changed on purpose, for a reason written down in the commit, and neither should get silently overwritten by a future cherry-pick.

**RX NAPI is disabled once, not twice, on device removal.** mt7921e_unregister_device() and mt7925e_unregister_device() already disable every RX NAPI instance before mt76_dma_cleanup() runs. Upstream commit 8be40d4b194c ("wifi: mt76: Disable napi when removing device") added a second napi_disable() inside mt76_dma_cleanup() itself, and a second call with no napi_enable() in between hangs forever, because napi_disable() leaves NAPI_STATE_SCHED set until something clears it. We reverted that commit (#72). If a future cherry-pick from openwrt touches mt76_dma_cleanup() or either driver's unregister path, check whether it's reintroducing that same double-disable before taking it. mt7915 and any other driver that never disabled RX NAPI on its own before deleting it will regain the unload warnings 8be40d4b194c was written to fix, until mt7915 gets its own local napi_disable() the way mt7921e/mt7925e already have one.

**mt7925 sets NO_VIRTUAL_MONITOR, not WANT_MONITOR_VIF.** Upstream asks mac80211 for a virtual monitor vif on every mt792x chip. Felix's tree splits it by chip. We now skip the virtual monitor on all of them (#76). The reason: mac80211's ieee80211_set_monitor_channel() only assigns a real per-vif channel context to a monitor vif when NO_VIRTUAL_MONITOR is set; under WANT_MONITOR_VIF, an explicitly-created active monitor vif has no virtual-monitor state to attach to, so channel setup silently no-ops and active monitor never receives a chanctx or any beacons. NO_VIRTUAL_MONITOR fixes that; testing found no passive-monitor regression on mt7921 (USB and PCIe), mt7925 (USB), or MT7927 (all three bands). If a future cherry-pick touches the hw_set() calls in mt792x_core.c's init_wiphy and tries to reintroduce WANT_MONITOR_VIF or a per-chip split, keep NO_VIRTUAL_MONITOR unconditional unless upstream has separately fixed the underlying mac80211 gap for active monitor vifs.

## Keeping it building on old kernels

The tree has to build all the way down to kernel 6.12, because that's what current Debian ships and plenty of people are on it. When the kernel changes the shape of something between 6.12 and now, we guard it right in the code:

    /* compat: radio_idx added to ieee80211_ops in kernel 6.17 */
    #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(6, 17, 0)
    static int mt7921_config(struct ieee80211_hw *hw, int radio_idx, u32 changed)
    #else
    static int mt7921_config(struct ieee80211_hw *hw, u32 changed)
    #endif

Three habits keep these from getting away from us:

- Put a /* compat: ... */ comment one line above every guard. Then you can find all of them at once with grep -rn '/\* compat:' .
- The newer signature goes on top, the older one underneath.
- When we drop support for a kernel old enough that a guard isn't needed anymore, grep the comment and delete them in one go.

No patch files, no configure step. The compiler picks the right side of the guard from the kernel headers it's building against.

## Test before it lands

The least you should do before pushing anything:

- Build on the floor, kernel 6.12. A Pi on current Debian is an easy one to keep around for this.
- Build on something recent, 6.17 or newer.

    make clean && make -j$(nproc)

Zero errors, zero warnings. If the compiler starts warning on code you just touched, that's usually the sign a cherry-pick conflict went sideways. Go back and look before you push.

## About the compat-patches/ folder

Don't let the name fool you. Nothing in the build applies those. There's no step in the Makefile or the install script that runs patch against them. The one file in there is a record, it writes down the inline compat edits that went into the eeprom files for the 6.6 header rename so there's a trail. The real compat work lives in the code as guards, not as patch files in that folder.
